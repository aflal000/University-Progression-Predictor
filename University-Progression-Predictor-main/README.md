Student Progression System
This Python program allows users to input student progression data based on module results (Pass, Defer, and Fail credits) and categorizes them into four outcomes: Progress, Trailer, Retriever, and Exclude.

Features:
User Input Validation: Ensures only valid integer values within the accepted range (0-120) are entered.
Automated Categorization: Determines the student's progression outcome based on entered credit values.
Data Storage: Stores entered progression data for later analysis.
Graphical Representation: Displays a histogram using Python's graphics module to visualize progression trends.
Usage:
Run the script and input Pass, Defer, and Fail credits.
The program will categorize the student's progression outcome.
Enter 'y' to continue adding more student data or 'q' to exit and display the histogram.
Technologies Used:
Python
graphics.py for histogram visualization
How to Run:
Ensure you have graphics.py installed. If not, download it and place it in the same directory as the script. Then, run:
